Task: Map the operational workflows end-to-end as implemented.

Output (separate sections):
A) Case lifecycle (create → schedule → dashboard → verify → timeout/debrief → complete)
B) Inventory lifecycle (catalog → check-in → location assignment → use → reconciliation if any)
C) Case Cards lifecycle (create/edit/version/status → link to case → print → feedback/review)

For each step:
- route(s) involved
- key components involved
- data reads/writes (API calls, DB operations)
- gating/role restrictions
No speculation; only what is implemented in code.
