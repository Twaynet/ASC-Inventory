Task: Inventory the application's navigation entrypoints and how users traverse the app.

Output:
1) All nav components and where they render (layout/page)
2) All links produced by nav components (path + label + conditions)
3) Redirect rules and default landings (auth vs unauth)
4) Deep-link entrypoints (routes intended to be entered directly)
5) Any unreachable routes discovered (no links, but still present)

Include file paths and keep it factual.
