Task: Produce a COMPREHENSIVE SNAPSHOT of authentication + authorization.

Output:
1) Where auth is established (providers, middleware, server/client boundaries)
2) Session/user model shape (fields used, types, source of truth)
3) Roles and capabilities (where defined, full list, mapping if any)
4) Enforcement points (middleware, layouts, pages, components, API calls)
5) Any debug/trace tooling that explains allow/deny
6) Call out any inconsistencies or duplicated logic (factual only)

Use a deterministic outline. Include file paths for every item.
